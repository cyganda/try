		<p> One of the top Palawan destinations is the UNESCO World Heritage Site and New 7 Wonders of Nature, the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park, or the Underground River. Puerto Princesa, also known as <strong> The City in a Forest</strong>, is rich in various unknown but must-see tourist spots that make it worth a visit for more than just a day. You can choose to visit its historical sights, natural parks, outdoor adventure spots, and shopping centers. It also has several island and beach destinations for island-hopping adventures where you can eat the freshest seafood. The best time to go to the island is during the dry and summer season from November to May. There's less chance of rainfall from April to June, which means you get to enjoy the majority of inland and water activities on the island.</p> <hr>

		<p> At the northern end of Palawan island is Coron that is famous for its shipwreck and crystal clear lagoons. Coron is best known for world-class World War II-era wreck diving, the island also offers limestone karst landscapes, beautiful beaches, crystal-clear freshwater lakes, and shallow-water coral reefs. Coron is a separate group of islands from the main Palawan island. All of the islands here are part of the Calamian Archipelago in Northern Palawan. Often compared to El Nido, a popular Palawan destination, Coron has a unique charm of its own. You can hop on a boat and head to the stunning islands for quality snorkeling, scuba or wreck diving, and beach camping. You can also hike up a mountain for a stunning sunset or dip in a hot spring. </p> <hr>
