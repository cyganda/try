		<p>Camiguin is a small and peaceful island province in the Philippines located in the Bohol Sea off the northern coast of Mindanao. It may be the smallest island in Mindanao and the second smallest province in the Philippines, but it has surprisingly a lot of tourist spots to offer. Dubbed the “Island Born of Fire,” Camiguin is home to seven volcanoes that continue to shape and reshape its unique landscape. This compact island also hides numerous waterfalls, natural springs, unspoiled beaches and diving spots that will please adventurous travelers. Camiguin is home to a mysterious Sunken Cemetery which continues to fascinate travelers from all over the world.</p> <hr>
