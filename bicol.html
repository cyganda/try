		<p>The Bicol region or simply Bicol refers to the 6 provinces in the southern part of Luzon comprised of Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Albay, Sorsogon in the mainland and offshore are Catanduanes and Masbate. The province is also known by another name, Ibalon, although the origin is unclear. The adequate flatland is utilised for farming and agriculture whilst the different bays yield commercial fishing. Bicol is surrounded by 7 mountains and the most famous of them all is the majestic Mount Mayon, named after a legendary princess ‘Daragang Magayon’ (Beautiful Lady). This serves as the main landmark of Albay province and considered to be the world’s most perfectly formed volcano and as such, is protected as a Natural Park. </p> <hr>
