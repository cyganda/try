		<p>Siargao, a teardrop-shaped small island located at the northeastern coast of Mindanao, is known as <strong> the Surfing Capital of the Philippines. </strong> Cloud 9, one of the surfing spots in Siargao, is the reason why this laidback island came into the radar of international travelers. For non-surfers, Siargao can also be a good destination for a much-needed island getaway. There are white sand beaches, picturesque islands, blue-green waters perfect for snorkeling and diving, waterfalls, lagoons, and caves. The best time to plan your Siargao trip depends on your purpose: surfing or island or beach lounging. If surfing is your main agenda for traveling to Siargao, then plan your trip sometime between July to November. These months are the peak surfing season in Siargao. For non-surfers, any time between March to September is ideal. It is sunny, so the waters are clearer. </p> <hr>
