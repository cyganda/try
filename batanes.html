		<p> Batanes, called the Home of the Winds, is considered the smallest province in the Philippines with only 230 kilometers of total land area. Part of Batanes’ charm comes from its somewhat seclusion from its busier and more crowded neighboring provinces. As the northernmost province in the country, its distance, size, and small population help preserve the unspoiled beauty of the place and the peaceful lifestyle of its people. A trip to Batanes is a welcome escape from the hustle and bustle of city living. Batanes’ refreshingly chill and peaceful vibe gives local and foreign travelers a different taste of island life. One that is simpler, laidback, quiet, but definitely revitalizing. </p> <hr>
