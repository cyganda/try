		<p>When it comes to tourist spots in the Philippines, nothing is as diverse as Cebu, the Queen City of the South, and the oldest city in the country. Outside of Luzon, it's one of the highly urbanized cities in the country next to the capital Manila. While most cultural and historic attractions are found in the capital, the best-known tourist spots in Cebu can be found all over the island. Cebu Province celebrates extravagant festivals, and the Sinulog Festival is the biggest of them all. You can witness the colorful Sinulog Festival on the third Sunday of January. It is to celebrate and honor the patron saint of Cebu, Santo Ni√±o. The ideal time to visit Cebu City for hot-weather activities would be from early January to mid-April. These months are perfect because they are not too hot, and at the same time, they receive less rainfall than the other months. </p> <hr>
