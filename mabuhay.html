					<td> <h3> NATIONAL HERO </h3>  <p> <strong> JosÃ© Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda</strong>; June 19, 1861 â€“ December 30, 1896) was a Filipino nationalist and polymath during the tail end of the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines. He is tagged as the national hero <em> (pambansang bayani) </em> of the Filipino people. An ophthalmologist by profession, Rizal became a writer and a key member of the Filipino Propaganda Movement, which advocated political reforms for the colony under Spain.

					<td> <h3> NATIONAL COSTUME </h3> <p> The <strong>barong tagalog</strong>, more commonly known simply as <em>barong</em> (and occasionally <em>baro</em>), is an embroidered long-sleeved formal shirt for men and a national dress of the Philippines. Barong tagalog combines elements from both the precolonial native Filipino and colonial Spanish clothing styles. It is traditionally made with sheer textiles (nipis) woven from piÃ±a or abacÃ¡; although in modern times, cheaper materials like silk, ramie, or polyester are also used. It is a common formal or semi-formal attire in Filipino culture, and is worn untucked over an undershirt with belted trousers and dress shoes. 
					<strong> Baro't saya </strong> is the feminine equivalent of barong tagalog, with the Maria Clara gown being the formal variant of the latter. Barong tagalog was also known as camisa fuera <em>("outer shirt")</em> in Spanish. </p> <hr> </td>
